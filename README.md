## 🚀 Overview

`iristest-html` is a lightweight reporting tool that transforms raw IRIS `%UnitTest` output into a modern, readable HTML report — inspired by tools like `pytest-html`.

It helps developers, testers, and teams visualize test results, share test runs, and improve traceability in both development and CI/CD pipelines.
